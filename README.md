# SAPASTelemetry

This repository is a copy of karthikvenkat17 his SAP Autoscaling project.
This one is only containing the 'telemetry' part.
The "SAPASautoscaling" repository holds the 'SAP autoscaling' part.

I have split it up for testing purposes along with Terraform cloud 
(I haven't figured out how to pull in seperate terraform projects that are located under a single github repo)
